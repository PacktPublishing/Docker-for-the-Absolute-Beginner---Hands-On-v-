## About the Video Course
Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud. This course introduces Docker to an absolute beginner using really simple and easy to understand lectures. Lectures are followed by demos showing how to setup and get started with Docker. The coding exercises that accompany this course will help you practice Docker commands, develop your own images using Dockerfiles, and practice Docker compose. You will be developing Docker files for different use cases right in your browser. This way you donâ€™t really need to have your own environment setup to get some hands-on practice. The coding exercises will validate your commands and Dockerfiles and ensure you have written them correctly. And finally we have assignments to put your skills to test. You will be given a challenge to solve using the skills you gained during this course. This is a great way to gain real-life project experience, work with other students in the community to develop a Dockerfile, and get feedback for your work. The assignment will push you to research and develop your own Docker images
